# Hello world!
My name is **Paulo Jannig**, and I am a Brazilian molecular biologist and exercise physiologist with a passion for studying gene regulation. 
In addition to my work in these fields, I have a strong interest in bioinformatics and have had the opportunity to incorporate this into my research. 

I am currently working as a researcher at the **Karolinska Institutet** in Stockholm, Sweden, where I work in the lab of Jorge Ruas ([ruaslab.science](https://ruaslab.science/)). 

As a lifelong learner who is constantly looking for new ways to challenge myself and improve my skills, I am excited to be a part of the GitHub community and to share my work and collaborate with others.

Thank you for stopping by my profile!
